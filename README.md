# AN ANALYTICAL REPORT ON VEHICLE CO₂ EMISSIONS IN CANADA

## Introduction

In response to the ongoing global efforts to combat climate change, this report presents an analytical overview of CO₂ emissions from vehicles in Canada. The data used for this study was sourced from a reliable automotive dataset containing detailed information about various car models, their fuel types, vehicle classes, and corresponding CO₂ emission levels. The purpose of this report is to identify the vehicles that contribute most to air pollution, highlight fuel-efficient alternatives, and support data-driven policy recommendations for sustainable transportation in Canada.

## Data Source

The dataset contains multiple columns including:

•	Model – The name of the vehicle.

•	Make – Manufacturer of the vehicle.

•	Vehicle_Class – Category of vehicle (e.g., SUV, compact, etc.)

•	Fuel_Type – Type of fuel used.

•	Fuel_Consumption_City/Highway/Combined – Measured in litres per 100 km.

•	CO2_Emissions_Grams – CO₂ emissions in grams per kilometer.

## Key Insights & Findings

•	The Top 10 CO₂-emitting vehicles have emission rates exceeding 500 g/km, mostly dominated by high-performance or large engine vehicles such as SUVs and luxury sedans.

•	The most fuel-efficient vehicles fall within the hybrid and electric categories, showing as little as 1.8–4.5 L/100 km, and emit CO₂ as low as 30–100 g/km.

•	A comparison across fuel types reveals that:

o	Diesel and regular gasoline vehicles produce the highest average emissions.

o	Electric and hybrid fuel types record significantly lower emissions.

•	The average CO₂ emissions per vehicle model highlight recurring models that consistently underperform in terms of environmental impact.

## Visual Insights from Power BI Dashboard

•	Bar Chart: Displaying the top 10 vehicles with the highest CO₂ emissions.

•	Cards: Used to show KPIs such as Highest CO₂ emission, Lowest CO₂ emission, and Average emissions.

•	Stacked Column Chart: Used to show average CO₂ emissions per fuel type.

•	Tooltip Table: When hovering over bars in the Top 10 chart, a detailed table appears showing exact emissions and vehicle details.

These visuals provide a quick, comprehensible snapshot of data-driven insights for non-technical stakeholders.

## Recommendations

•	Encourage incentives for purchasing hybrid and electric vehicles by offering rebates or tax cuts.

•	Introduce stricter regulations for high-emission vehicles, especially those exceeding 400 g/km.

•	Promote further investment in clean fuel infrastructure to support alternative fuel vehicles.

•	Launch public awareness campaigns highlighting the link between personal vehicle choice and national emission goals.

## Conclusion

This analysis underscores the urgent need for Canada to address vehicular CO₂ emissions through regulatory, economic, and infrastructural initiatives. The Power BI dashboard created in this project enables government stakeholders to clearly identify polluting trends and align decisions with environmental targets.
